# Startup Name Generator

This is one of my first Flutter Application, helping me to learn the basics of Flutter by following the Guide [Part one](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) and [Part two](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0).

## Use Case of this Application

In this App, a infinite List View is created, displaying random generated Names. It is possible to mark them as "favourites" and all of them will be displayed within an individual page.
